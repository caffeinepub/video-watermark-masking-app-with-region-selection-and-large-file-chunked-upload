# Frontend Environment Variables

# Unlisted Access Configuration
# The access secret is validated on the frontend and passed to backend methods
# Format: The URL hash should contain this exact secret value
# Example URL: https://your-app.ic0.app/#watermark-access-2026
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a build-time configuration example
# The actual secret is hardcoded in useUnlistedAccess.ts
# Change EXPECTED_SECRET in that file to customize your access secret
#
# For production, consider using a more secure secret generation method
